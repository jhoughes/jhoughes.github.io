  Technologies like virtualization, containers, and deployment automation should simplify work around IT operations and enable them to provide for the constantly changing needs of their organizations. As work to manage operations on-prem and in the cloud becomes increasingly challenging at scale, empowering IT teams and developers to consume resources more easily becomes a critical need. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a primary means to simplify these functions. It has become a significant driver for simplifying deployment efforts for infrastructure teams in the past few years and easing the overhead of managing environments at scale.

  <time datetime="2019-11-27T15:22:17-0700" class="post-date">Wed, Nov 27, 2019</time>
  About a month after my presentation of my &ldquo;From Scripting to Toolmaking: Taking the Next Step With Powershell&rdquo; session presented at SpiceWorld 2019, I presented the same topic to the Austin PowerShell User Group.
Having a longer period of time to give my presentation led to me being a little bit less rushed, and gave me some time to demo some advanced methods for better performance with PowerShell.
You can get more details on the presentation in my blog post about SpiceWorld, the video of the presentation here, and the version of the slides from this session here.

  The leaders of the NY/NJ VMUG chapters selected me to present to their usercon in September 2019, for a session titled &ldquo;Being Effective at Technical Communication - Technology Not Required&rdquo;.
This session is meant to help IT Pros more effectively deliver their presentations and messages, both within their current organizations, and throughout their careers.
Many of us focus too much on the technology which is part of our roles, and we do not give enough attention to developing soft skills such as effective communications.

  I got selected to present at SpiceWorld (hosted by Spiceworks) in September 2019, for a session titled &ldquo;From Scripting to Toolmaking: Taking the Next Step With Powershell&rdquo;. I also got to attend a great PowerShell workshop and a few sessions by one of my PowerShell heroes, Jeff Hicks, and to chat with another Microsoft MVP and Veeam Vanguard, Dave Kuwala. It was pretty cool to see my picture next to these two on the speakers page.

  I have had requests to make my slides from the newest &ldquo;Automate Yourself Out of a Backup Job&rdquo; presentation available, so I am finally getting them posted here for public download.
The attachment is only a PDF export of the presentation slides themselves.
I will be working on recording my demo videos with some added voiceover, so they will be available outside of the recorded breakout sessions posted on the VeeamON site.

  After too long of a hiatus, I am out in Silicon Valley this week for the honor of being a first-time delegate for Tech Field Day, specifically at the Storage Field Day 17 event. I&rsquo;ve still got posts coming from TFDx at VMworld 2018.
This is the event specific page where you can find out more about Storage Field Day 17.
Here is where you can learn more about the awesomeness that is the ecosystem of Tech Field Day.

  I just wanted to post this up in case it helps someone else out.
Short recap: Starting yesterday, when our VBR server was inadvertently rebooted and finished applying some patches that were outstanding for many weeks (don&rsquo;t get me started on the fiasco of a background story), we started getting multiple failures and error messages. I only caught this while doing a job reconfiguration and trying to map a cloned job to an existing backup chain, which was failing with an error of &ldquo;Unable to perform data sovereignty check&hellip;&quot;.

  Whew, that title is a mouthful. This post will cover the installation and configuration of the Pure Storage plugin for Veeam Backup &amp; Recovery, but we&rsquo;ll incorporate some background first.
One of the most significant enhancements released with Veeam 9.5U3 is one from which most users have not seen direct improvement &mdash; until now. The specific enhancement that I am referring to is the Universal Storage API, which is the framework that storage vendors can leverage to integrate their storage arrays to allow for Veeam to offload snapshots for backup &amp; recovery operations to the array, rather than relying on VMware snapshots.

  We are testing out two new ExaGrid 40000E appliances. These will be new initial target repositories for backups from Veeam Backup &amp; Recovery. This is a prime opportunity to get out another article about the install and initialization of the ExaGrid hardware. I intend to follow with a post about the benefits of the Veeam integration.
ExaGrid is an exceptional idea for their layout with the distinct partitions of a &ldquo;landing zone&rdquo; and &ldquo;retention zone&rdquo;.

  Early this year, there were talks of Cisco acquiring Turbonomic. A few months back this became a partnership to release Cisco Workload Optimization Manager (CWOM). This is one of the newest products included in the Cisco ONE Enterprise Cloud Suite.
Cisco Workload Optimization Manager is now in its 1.1.3 release. Starting with this release, you can target UCS Director as an orchestration target. I would love to leverage this, I now need to get UCS Director back into the environment).

This has been a big year of change for me with regards to my career, personal life, and social presence. As such, I want to share some reflection. This relates to my own experience as someone new to sharing knowledge with others.

  We recently upgraded a few of our UCS domains from 3.1(1h) and 3.1(2b) up to 3.2(1d) and we had issues with a few IO modules hanging for up to 2 hours with trying to activate the firmware.
The backup version was updated with no issues, but then the activation stalled through anywhere from 16 to 30 tries before failing.
We decided to leave most of the faulted IOMs alone to see what they would do, but after 2 hours we decided to attempt a reset of one IO module, and that just made it angry&hellip;

  Howdy everyone, this is Joe. I recently got accepted into the vExpert program for 2017 (second half) mostly based on internal and vendor community contributions.
It&rsquo;s now time to become a bit more social and share what I can with the wider community.
I&rsquo;m starting off with adding VMware content about the VMworld 2017 experience. Along with that I&rsquo;ll be sharing experiences a UCS, PowerShell and VEEAM, and we&rsquo;ll see where things go.
