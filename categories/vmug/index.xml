      <description>The leaders of the NY/NJ VMUG chapters selected me to present to their usercon in September 2019, for a session titled &amp;ldquo;Being Effective at Technical Communication - Technology Not Required&amp;rdquo;.
This session is meant to help IT Pros more effectively deliver their presentations and messages, both within their current organizations, and throughout their careers.
Many of us focus too much on the technology which is part of our roles, and we do not give enough attention to developing soft skills such as effective communications.</description>
