      <description>I just wanted to post this up in case it helps someone else out.
Short recap: Starting yesterday, when our VBR server was inadvertently rebooted and finished applying some patches that were outstanding for many weeks (don&amp;rsquo;t get me started on the fiasco of a background story), we started getting multiple failures and error messages. I only caught this while doing a job reconfiguration and trying to map a cloned job to an existing backup chain, which was failing with an error of &amp;ldquo;Unable to perform data sovereignty check&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>We are testing out two new ExaGrid 40000E appliances. These will be new initial target repositories for backups from Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Recovery. This is a prime opportunity to get out another article about the install and initialization of the ExaGrid hardware. I intend to follow with a post about the benefits of the Veeam integration.
ExaGrid is an exceptional idea for their layout with the distinct partitions of a &amp;ldquo;landing zone&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;retention zone&amp;rdquo;.</description>
