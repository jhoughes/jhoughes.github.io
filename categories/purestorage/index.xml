      <description>Technologies like virtualization, containers, and deployment automation should simplify work around IT operations and enable them to provide for the constantly changing needs of their organizations. As work to manage operations on-prem and in the cloud becomes increasingly challenging at scale, empowering IT teams and developers to consume resources more easily becomes a critical need. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a primary means to simplify these functions. It has become a significant driver for simplifying deployment efforts for infrastructure teams in the past few years and easing the overhead of managing environments at scale.</description>

      <description>Whew, that title is a mouthful. This post will cover the installation and configuration of the Pure Storage plugin for Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Recovery, but we&amp;rsquo;ll incorporate some background first.
One of the most significant enhancements released with Veeam 9.5U3 is one from which most users have not seen direct improvement &amp;mdash; until now. The specific enhancement that I am referring to is the Universal Storage API, which is the framework that storage vendors can leverage to integrate their storage arrays to allow for Veeam to offload snapshots for backup &amp;amp; recovery operations to the array, rather than relying on VMware snapshots.</description>
