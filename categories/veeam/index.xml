      <description>I have had requests to make my slides from the newest &amp;ldquo;Automate Yourself Out of a Backup Job&amp;rdquo; presentation available, so I am finally getting them posted here for public download.
The attachment is only a PDF export of the presentation slides themselves.
I will be working on recording my demo videos with some added voiceover, so they will be available outside of the recorded breakout sessions posted on the VeeamON site.</description>

      <description>I just wanted to post this up in case it helps someone else out.
Short recap: Starting yesterday, when our VBR server was inadvertently rebooted and finished applying some patches that were outstanding for many weeks (don&amp;rsquo;t get me started on the fiasco of a background story), we started getting multiple failures and error messages. I only caught this while doing a job reconfiguration and trying to map a cloned job to an existing backup chain, which was failing with an error of &amp;ldquo;Unable to perform data sovereignty check&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>I had some folks who have asked for a copy of my presentation titled &amp;lsquo;Automate Yourself Out of a (Backup) Job&amp;rsquo;.
Below is both a PDF export of the presentation slides, along with a copy of the full PPT with the embedded videos.
PDF Version is available here, and the full PowerPoint version with embedded videos is available here.
I hope this helps y&amp;rsquo;all out on your path and gives you some benefit within your own environments.</description>

      <title>Installing the Pure Storage plugin for Veeam Backup &amp; Recovery Snapshot Integration</title>

      <description>Whew, that title is a mouthful. This post will cover the installation and configuration of the Pure Storage plugin for Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Recovery, but we&amp;rsquo;ll incorporate some background first.
One of the most significant enhancements released with Veeam 9.5U3 is one from which most users have not seen direct improvement &amp;mdash; until now. The specific enhancement that I am referring to is the Universal Storage API, which is the framework that storage vendors can leverage to integrate their storage arrays to allow for Veeam to offload snapshots for backup &amp;amp; recovery operations to the array, rather than relying on VMware snapshots.</description>

      <title>Exagrid Installation and Initialization</title>

      <description>We are testing out two new ExaGrid 40000E appliances. These will be new initial target repositories for backups from Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Recovery. This is a prime opportunity to get out another article about the install and initialization of the ExaGrid hardware. I intend to follow with a post about the benefits of the Veeam integration.
ExaGrid is an exceptional idea for their layout with the distinct partitions of a &amp;ldquo;landing zone&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;retention zone&amp;rdquo;.</description>
