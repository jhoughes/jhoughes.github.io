      <description>Whew, that title is a mouthful. This post will cover the installation and configuration of the Pure Storage plugin for Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Recovery, but we&amp;rsquo;ll incorporate some background first.
One of the most significant enhancements released with Veeam 9.5U3 is one from which most users have not seen direct improvement &amp;mdash; until now. The specific enhancement that I am referring to is the Universal Storage API, which is the framework that storage vendors can leverage to integrate their storage arrays to allow for Veeam to offload snapshots for backup &amp;amp; recovery operations to the array, rather than relying on VMware snapshots.</description>
