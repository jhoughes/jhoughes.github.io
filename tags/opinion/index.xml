      <description>Howdy, this is Joe Houghes. I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce myself some in my first real post before I try and speak about technical content. This has been a big year of change for me with regards to my career, personal life, and social presence. As such, I want to share some reflection. This relates to my own experience as someone new to sharing knowledge with others.
I&amp;rsquo;m a run of the mill 35-year-old out of shape IT geek who is a native of Austin, Texas.</description>
