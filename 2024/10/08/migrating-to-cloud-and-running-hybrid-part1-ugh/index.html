  <h1>Migrating to Cloud and Running Hybrid: Part 1 - Ugh</h1>
  <time datetime=2024-10-08T14:13:21-0700 class="post-date">Tue, Oct 8, 2024</time>
  <p>These days, businesses are realizing that sticking to just one cloud or one type of environment doesn’t cut it anymore. The reality is, most organizations need the flexibility to run workloads wherever it makes the most sense—whether that’s in their own on-premises setup, in the cloud, or a mix of both.</p>
<p>A hybrid approach can be a game-changer, letting companies keep critical data or legacy systems on-prem while still taking advantage of the scalability and innovation that public cloud platforms offer. But it doesn’t stop there. As things change—whether it’s costs, technical needs, or capacity—workloads often need to shift between clouds.</p>
<p>And here’s the thing: these migrations aren’t just a one-and-done deal. Businesses constantly adapt to new priorities, compliance requirements, or better offerings from cloud providers. That’s why having the tools and solutions to easily switch things up is so important. It’s all about staying flexible, agile, and ready for whatever comes next in today’s fast-moving digital world.</p>
<p>One of the biggest factors that makes it possible for businesses to move workloads between clouds is data portability. At the end of the day, data isn’t just another asset—it’s the lifeblood of the organization and often proprietary. That means it needs to be handled with a whole lot more care than the applications or operating systems that interact with it.</p>
<p>Think about it: moving data is a bit like moving a priceless piece of art. You wouldn’t just toss it in the back of a truck and hope for the best—you’d make sure it’s packed, protected, and handled with care every step of the way. The same mindset applies to managing and protecting critical business data.</p>
<p>This is where modern practices like infrastructure as code come in. By treating infrastructure as something prescriptive and repeatable—almost like a blueprint—you make it much easier to rebuild environments consistently, no matter where they’re running. Combine that with stronger cyber resilience measures, and you’ve got a solid defense against the risks that can come with migrating data.</p>
<p>When businesses have these systems and safeguards in place, the idea of moving workloads across clouds shifts from being a daunting challenge to a realistic, achievable goal. It’s all about creating the right foundation, so businesses can stay flexible, protect what matters most, and take full advantage of what the cloud has to offer.</p>
<p>In the next few blog posts, we’ll talk about what is required for any customer to be successful with running their own hybrid cloud, both with migrating workloads across clouds, and how to help achieve the cloud operating model.</p>
<p>A hybrid cloud strategy offers some big advantages for businesses that need the best of both on-premises and cloud environments. One of the key benefits is seamless data mobility. With tools like Pure Cloud Block Store, you get a consistent storage experience whether you’re working with an on-premises FlashArray or in the cloud, like Azure or AWS. This means you can move applications and data between environments without needing to refactor them—making true hybrid cloud deployments not just possible but practical.</p>
<p>Another big perk is the versatility of hybrid cloud use cases. Think disaster recovery, dev/test environments, cloud bursting for handling traffic spikes, and more. By replicating data between your on-prem FlashArray and Pure Cloud Block Store, you’re ready for just about anything. For example, if your on-prem systems go down, your critical workloads can seamlessly fail over to the cloud, keeping your business running smoothly.</p>
<p>Speaking of replication, data protection across hybrid environments is another major advantage. Pure Storage makes it easy to replicate data between FlashArray systems and Pure Cloud Block Store. This kind of flexibility means you can create robust disaster recovery strategies that span both on-prem and cloud setups.</p>
<p>And let’s not forget the financial side: cloud-based disaster recovery is a cost-effective way to leverage the cloud as a backup solution. Instead of maintaining a full DR site on-prem, you can use Pure Cloud Block Store as a failover option when needed. If an issue arises, fail over to the cloud, and when everything’s back to normal, fail back—simple, efficient, and budget-friendly.</p>
<p>With these advantages, a hybrid cloud strategy gives businesses the flexibility, resilience, and cost efficiency they need to adapt and thrive in an ever-changing digital landscape.</p>
<p>Pure Storage offers a range of benefits that make it an ideal solution for modern businesses. It&rsquo;s industry-leading storage platform delivers incredible performance, which ensures your most demanding workloads run smoothly and efficiently.</p>
<p>On top of that, Pure&rsquo;s data reduction technology optimizes storage across the entire array, allowing you to cut costs even in the public cloud. And when it comes to protecting your data, Pure has you covered with enterprise-grade security and resilience features.</p>
<p>Tools like SafeMode Snapshots provide robust safeguards and fast recovery options, ensuring your critical information is secure and your operations stay up and running, even during unexpected disruptions. With its speed, efficiency, and resilience, Pure Storage is built to meet the needs of today’s dynamic business environments.</p>
<p>In the posts within this series, we’re going to look at how customers can be successful with getting their workloads to the cloud with Pure Storage and the Cloud Block Store product.  I look forward to seeing you soon for the next post.</p>
